# CSS 225 – Module 4: Debugging Lab Activity

## Overview
This repository contains the **corrected versions** of Python programs submitted for the **Module 4 Debugging Lab** in CSS 225. The objective of this lab is to practice identifying and fixing common types of errors such as:

- **Syntax errors**
- **Variable name issues**
- **Logical errors**

Each program includes **inline comments** explaining the changes and code functionality.

## Files Included

| Filename        | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `time.py`       | Fixes time-related calculations and formatting issues.   |
| `time2.py`      | Expanded version of `time.py` with additional logic.     |
| `pirate.py`     | Fixes logic and output for pirate-themed dialogue.       |
| `branching.py`  | Corrects if-else branching and user input handling.      |
| `grading.py`    | Fixes student grading logic and rounding errors.         |
| `collection.py` | Corrects list and dictionary manipulation issues.        |

## What Was Fixed?

- **Consistent indentation** and block structure.
- Resolved **NameError** due to undeclared variables.
- Corrected **if/else conditions** that were improperly structured.
- Replaced **invalid syntax** (e.g., missing colons, quotation marks).
- Enhanced code **readability** through comments and naming conventions.
